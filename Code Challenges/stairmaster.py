Stairmaster

Write a function, stairmaster(n), that will compute the number of ways
to climb a flight of n steps, taking 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time.

Take the example of climbing n = 4 steps. There are seven different
ways one can climb four stairs using 1, 2, or 3 steps at a time:
[1,1,1,1] [2,1,1] [1,2,1] [1,1,2] [2,2] [1,3] [3,1].

Make sure to find all permutations, not combinations, as the order
matters. Climbing one step then two steps is different from climbing
two steps then one step.

This challenge and variations of it were reported to have been asked at
interviews with Google. If youâ€™ve covered the material in Pass the
Technical Interview with Python or an equivalent, you should be able to
solve this challenge. If you have trouble, try refreshing your
knowledge there first.
