Prime Number Finder

Create a prime_finder() function that takes in a number, n, and returns
all the prime numbers from 1 to n (inclusive). As a reminder, a prime
number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.

For example, prime_finder(11) should return [2, 3, 5, 7, 11].

Variations of this challenge have been reported to have been asked at
interviews with Facebook. If youâ€™ve covered the material in Pass the
Technical Interview with Python or an equivalent, you should be able to
solve this challenge. If you have trouble, try refreshing your
knowledge there first.
